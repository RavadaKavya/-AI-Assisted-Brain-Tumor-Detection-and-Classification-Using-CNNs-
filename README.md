**Project Title**
"AI-Assisted Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Using CNNs"

**Problem Statement**
This project addresses the critical need for accurate and efficient brain tumor detection and classification through advanced medical imaging techniques. The specific tasks include:
•	Classification: Differentiating between malignant and benign tumors.
•	Detection: Identifying the presence of a tumor within brain MRI images.
•	Significance: Early and accurate tumor detection improves patient outcomes and treatment strategies.

**Implementation Plan**
•	CNN Model Design: Inspired by the VGG-16 model, our CNN architecture will include convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model will be tailored for high-resolution MRI brain images, emphasizing feature extraction and classification accuracy.
•	Hyperparameters:
  Default settings: Learning rate (0.001), batch size (32), epochs (50).
  Tuning: Utilize grid search and cross-validation to optimize learning rate, batch size, and regularization parameters.
•	Preventing Overfitting:
  Data Augmentation: Apply rotation, flipping, and zooming techniques to enrich the dataset.
  Dropout Layers: Integrate dropout in fully connected layers to reduce overfitting.
  Early Stopping: Monitor validation loss to stop training when performance plateaus.

**Dataset**
  The data will be split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets.

**Data Handling and Performance Evaluation**
•	Data Splitting: Stratified splitting to maintain tumor-type proportions across datasets.
•	Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for classification performance. Intersection over Union (IoU) for detection tasks.
•	Augmentation: Implement image data augmentation to increase the robustness and generalizability of the model.
